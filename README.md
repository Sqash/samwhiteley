This is code for my personal homepage.

##TODO

1. Determine/create palette

2. Define defaults for color/style
    - h1-6 + p + small
    - a, a:LVFHT
    - background
    - pane-background
    - scroll-bar

3. Make mixins for standard css
    - floating content panes

4. Animate nav and maybe certain links (project code).

## Color ideas

Dark backgrounds (deep blue -> slightly lighter/transparent blue & purple)
Yellow links (almost white, hover darkens)
Light text ('small' goes transparent white/blue/yellow?)
Nav links have only shadows. text-shadow and expand shadow animations on hover
